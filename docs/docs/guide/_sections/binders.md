Binders are the sets of instructions that tell Rivets.js how to update the DOM when an observed property changes. Rivets.js comes bundled with a handful commonly-used binders for your convenience. See the [Binder Reference](/docs/reference/) to learn more about the built-in binders that are available out of the box.

While you can accomplish most UI tasks with the built-in binders, it is highly encouraged to extend Rivets.js with your own binders that are specific to the needs of your application.
